Silver Market Structural Analysis 📊
End-to-End Data Analysis & Business Intelligence Project

This repository contains an end-to-end data analysis project focused on the global silver market, examining demand, supply, market balance, and price dynamics from 2016 to Q1 2025.

The project demonstrates my ability to source authoritative datasets, clean and transform data, build analytical models in Power BI using DAX, and communicate complex market insights clearly to executive, investor, and board-level audiences.

The analysis highlights how silver has evolved from a traditional precious metal into a strategic industrial and macro-sensitive asset.

🚀 Project Structure – Analytical Workflow

This project follows a real-world analytical delivery pipeline, from raw data to executive insights.

1️⃣ Data Collection & Validation

Sourced demand and supply data from The Silver Institute

Sourced price data from Kaggle

Reviewed data consistency across years and categories

Verified units and reporting standards

📌 Outcome: Trusted, industry-grade datasets ready for analysis

2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Transformation

Standardised demand and supply categories across years

Resolved inconsistencies and missing values

Normalised all quantities to million ounces

Separated historical data from forecast periods

📌 Outcome: Clean, analysis-ready datasets with consistent structure

3️⃣ Power BI Data Modelling

Designed a star-schema model

Created fact tables for:

Demand

Supply

Price

Built dimension tables for:

Year

Category

Sub-category

📌 Outcome: Scalable and performant BI data model

4️⃣ DAX Measures & Analytics

Custom DAX measures created include:

Total Demand & Total Supply

Demand–Supply Deficit

Category Contribution (% of total)

CAGR (2016–2024)

Rolling averages and trendlines

Deficit–price relationship indicators

📌 Outcome: Dynamic, insight-driven analytics rather than static reporting

5️⃣ Exploratory & Visual Analysis

Analysed demand composition and growth drivers

Assessed supply elasticity and constraints

Identified persistent market deficits post-2020

Examined price behaviour in relation to deficits

📌 Outcome: Clear evidence of a structural market imbalance

<img width="631" height="380" alt="Market Analysis Dashboard" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0686c5fe-5fc4-4735-886f-f8a8569f3cb2" />
6️⃣ Insights & Executive Storytelling

Key findings communicated through Power BI dashboards and presentation-ready visuals:

Industrial demand growth (+76%) dominates the market

Supply remains flat despite rising prices

Persistent deficits of 150–250M oz annually

Price appreciation aligns closely with deficit expansion

📌 Outcome: Insights clearly supported by data and visuals

📈 Key Insights

Silver demand has undergone a structural shift, driven by industrial use

Supply is structurally constrained and price-inelastic

The market has been in a persistent deficit since 2020

Price movements are fundamentally driven, not speculative

Silver now behaves as a strategic industrial and macro-sensitive asset

📑 Presentation & Structural Thesis Validation

In addition to the Power BI dashboard, this repository includes a review-ready presentation that walks through the full analytical narrative — from raw data to executive conclusions.

📂 Included Files:

Silver_Market_Structural_Analysis_Presentation.pdf / .pptx – This presentation explicitly addresses common reviewer and investor questions, particularly whether the current market dynamics represent a cyclical fluctuation or a structural shift.

Common_Investor_Questions_Silver.pdf – A concise reference that compiles frequently asked questions by investors or potential investors in silver, enhancing the structural thesis validation and supporting data-driven investment decisions.

This addition ensures that the presentation not only demonstrates analytical rigor but also anticipates the perspectives and concerns of investors, making the narrative more persuasive and actionable.
